 “Soft” volumetric parcellations were re-sampled by projecting each map separately. To re-sample “hard” volumetric parcellations, we first converted them to “soft” parcellations and then once ultimately in fs LR 32k space, the “hard” parcellation was reconstructed by assigning each vertex to the parcel with the highest “soft” value. Once parcellations were projected into fsaverage space, these parcellations, in addition to a collection of others which could only be found in fsaverage space, were re-sampled to fs LR 32k space with tools available for the Human Connectome Project Workbench (Marcus, 2011).
