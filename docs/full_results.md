# Full Results Table

The full results from the [Multiple Parcellations Experiment](./index#multiple-parcellation-strategies) are shown in the table below.
These show [mean relative rankings](./results_intro#mean-rank) as
averaged across both [target variables](./variables.html) and [ML pipelines](./ml_pipelines.html).
Mean R2 and ROC AUC are calculated only from their relevant subsets of 22 and 23 [target variables](./variables.html) respectively.
