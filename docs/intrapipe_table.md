# Intra-Pipeline Table

This table includes results from the base experiment single parcellation [intra-pipeline comparison](./by_pipeline#intra-pipeline-comparison).
The [mean relative rankings](./results_intro#mean-rank) shown here are as
averaged across [target variables](./variables.html) and as computed for each [ML pipeline](./ml_pipelines.html) separately. 
Mean R2 and ROC AUC are calculated only from their relevant subsets of 22 and 23 [target variables](./variables.html) respectively.

*Table columns are sortable!*
