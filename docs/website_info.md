## Why a project website?

While in practice it may not have succeeded, one of the core ideas around a project website was to gradually release complexity.
That is to say, the front-page should contain ideally roughly the information / information density as found on a project poster. Casual readers
will then go no further than this page and should be left with enough information to get a full idea of the project. The next layer of complexity
is then the hyper-links present on the index page. These allow for ideally limitless if needed more detailed / nuanced discussions about certain details.
Especially in a project like this one which covers a relatively wide span of different complex ideas, and given the fundamental restriction that all readers will be
coming in which different backgrounds and interests, this format offers an optional more detailed look into any specific piece. The next release of complexity beyond this would
be hyper-links from hyper-links, where at this stage the level of detail starts to get closer and closer to code-level detail. 

A good example of this principle is perhaps the page on [resampling parcellations](./resample_parcellations.html), which goes into about as much detail as possible without sharing actual code, and then also links to the actual code. On the other hand, as the details around how parcellations were resampled will not be of interest to most readers, this advanced topic will only be stumbled upon by someone first interested on the [index page](.index.html) in learning more about the [different parcellations used](./parcellations.md) and then from that page, someone interested in how existing parcellations were re-sampled (then onto either the specific project code or links to external tools used here). In this way complexity can still exist and be easily accessible (versus in maybe a traditional publication where you have to download some supplementary materials pdf 50 pages long and scroll down to a section which may or may not include the details you are interested in).
