title: Whats best
description: Across different scales what performs best
---

Across different pieces of the analyses we have established a number of different interesting, but perhaps hard to piece together results.
For example, [existing parcellations perform better than random parcellations](./base_results.html).
This section of the project site is designed to focus in on only a subset of the results as informed by these prior findings.
The foundational points are as follows:

- [Existing parcellations perform better than random parcellations](./base_results.html)
- [SVM based pipelines were most competitive for single parcellations](./by_pipeline.html)
- [SVM based pipelines were also most competitive for ensembled parcellations](./ensemble_by_pipeline.html)
