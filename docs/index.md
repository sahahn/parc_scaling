## Project Introduction

Different parcellations and neuroimaging atlases are ubiquitous in neuroimaging, namely because they allow for a principled reduction of features (which has its own sleuth of benefits). This project focuses in particular on the question of choice of parcellation, in particular, how does choice of parcellation influence performance within a machine learning context.

[Background on Machine Learning for Neuroimaging](./ml_neuroimaging.html)

The base experiment conducted within this project was a systematic test of different pre-defined parcellations performance. The structure of the evaluation is shown below:

This study uses data from the ABCD Study release [NDA Collection 3165](https://collection3165.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
Specifically, we concatenate structural MRI measures to use as input features (See [Input Data](./input_data.html) for more information).
In total we employ 45 different phenotypic target variables (See [Variables Used](./variables.html)).


## Target Variables

A collection of 45 target phenotypic variables (23 binary and 22 continuous), used to gauge predictive performance, was sourced from the second ABCD Study release. Variables were sourced directly from the rds file made available by the DAIRC (specifically on a version of the rds file saved as a csv). All collected variables, both target and brain, are from the baseline time point on the study. Best efforts were made to source a list of representative, diverse and predictive variables. Towards this effort, a larger list of variables was originally screened on a subset of the data (n=2000) to avoid including variables not at all predictive from sMRI measures.

### Parcellations

Within this project we test a mix of different existing and randomly generated parcellations.

All considered surface parcellations were converted, if necessary, in the FS LR 32K standard left and right hemisphere standard vertex space. We consider two main sources for surface parcellations, existing and random. Lastly, a few additional variants are tested including downsampled and as extracted directly from FreeSurfer.

### Machine Learning (ML)

We employ three base ML pipelines, each with classifier and regressor variants, as a representative sample of different popular and predictive ML strategies. All machine learning experiments are conducted with BPt. Each pipeline is first composed of a loading component responsible for extracting ROIs according to the specified surface parcellation. The output from the loading step concatenates the extracted ROI values across each of the different surface values, generating a feature vector of length four times the number of parcels for each subject. Next, the ROI values are scaled using robust scaling, where each feature is standardized by first removing the median and then scaling according to the 5th and 95th percentiles of that features distribution. These features are then used as input to train a classifier or regressor under one of three different base configurations, these are:


#### Elastic-Net
The base model within the pipeline under this configuration is a logistic or linear regression with elastic-net penalty available from scikit-learn. A nested random hyper-parameter search over 60 combinations is evaluated through nested 3-fold CV to select the strength of regularization applied as well as the ratio between l1 and l2 regularization.

    param_search = Param_Search(search_type='RandomSearch', n_iter=60,
                                splits=3, n_repeats=1, cv=cv)

    model = Model('elastic', params=1,
                  param_search=param_search,
                  extra_params={'tol': 1e-3})

#### SVM
The base model within the pipeline under this configuration is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier or regressor with radial basis function kernel available from scikit-learn. A front end univariate feature selection procedure was further added to this pipeline configuration (based on the ANOVA f-value between a feature and the target variable). A nested random hyper-parameter search over 60 combinations is then evaluated through nested 3-fold CV in order to select the SVMâ€™s strength of regularization and kernel coefficient as well as the percent of features to keep in the front-end feature selector. All three hyper-parameters are optimized at the same time.

    param_search = Param_Search(search_type='RandomSearch', n_iter=60,
                                splits=3, n_repeats=1, cv=cv,
                                search_only_params={'svm classifier__probability': False})

    feat_selector =\
            [Feat_Selector('variance threshold'),
             Feat_Selector('univariate selection', params=2)]

    nested_svm_pipe =\
        Model_Pipeline(feat_selectors=feat_selector,
                       model=Model('svm', params=1, extra_params={'cache_size': 2000}),
                       param_search=param_search)

    model = Model(nested_svm_pipe)


#### LGBM
The base model optimized is an extreme gradient boosted tree based classifier and regressor from the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) package. The tuned hyper-parameters for this model included the type of boosting, the number of estimators, different tree sampling parameters, and regularization parameters. Given the high number of hyper-parameters to tune, 9, in contrast to the other base models, we employed a two point differential evolution based hyper-parameter search strategy implemented through the python library Nevergrad. The search was run for 180 iterations, where each set of parameters is evaluated with a single 25% nested validation split.


    lgbm_param_search =\
            Param_Search(search_type='TwoPointsDE', n_iter=180,
                         splits=0.25, n_repeats=1, cv=cv)

    model = Model('light gbm', params=1, param_search=lgbm_param_search)
