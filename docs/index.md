This project uses the idea of random surface parcellations extensively. Random parcellations are generated as follows: For a random parcellation of size N, N random points are first selected at random across both hemisphereâ€™s 59,412 vertices (medial wall vertices excluded). Each selected point is then assigned as the seed of a new region and is randomly assigned a size probability between 0 and 1. Next, a region is randomly selected according to a weighted random choice between all regions (e.g., if a region was assigned an initial probability of .5 it would be picked on average twice as often as a region assigned .25). A random vertex is then added to the selected region from the list of valid neighboring unassigned vertices. This sequence, of selecting a region and adding one valid vertex, is repeated until all regions have no unassigned neighbors and therefore all non-medial wall vertices are assigned to a region. 

Example generated random parcellation:

Note: The above example, in contrast to the random parcellations generated in this project, is in fsaverage5 space (vs. fs_LR_32k) and doesn't mask the medial wall (the medial wall is masked in this project).

Source code for generating random parcellations is implemented and available through the Brain Predictability toolbox (BPt) at https://github.com/sahahn/BPt/blob/master/BPt/extensions/random_parcellation.py. In this project, random parcels are generated within Setup/process_random_parcels.py script.
