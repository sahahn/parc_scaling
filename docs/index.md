It is common to analyze surface-based neuroimaging data, and likewise for a number of reasons to reduce surface data to a collection of representative regions of interest.
What about when one is interested in performing machine learning? Is there a best pre-defined parcellation to use? This project seeks to answer that question and more.

The base experiment conducted within this project was a systematic test of different pre-defined parcellations performance.
