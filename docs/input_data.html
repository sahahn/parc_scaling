Data is sourced from the ABCD Study release [NDA Collection 3165](https://collection3165.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
Data used within this study are the sMRI outputs of a modified HCP style pipeline.
We downloaded for each available subject their left and right hemisphere curvature,
sulcal depth, cortical thickness and unsmoothed myelin map, each in the standard FS LR 32k vertex space.
Likewise, we additionally downloaded each subject's automatically computed FreeSurfer ROI stats files. 

We chose to use structural MRI surfaces. That said, the idea of parcellations easily extends to
task-based fMRI and resting state fMRI just as easily as dMRI. The choice to use structural
MRI surfaces was therefore somewhat arbitrary, but given its ubiquity and the amount of
available studies which employ it, it may not be a bad choice. That said, future work may very
well consider different modalities or explicitly multi-modal fusion.
