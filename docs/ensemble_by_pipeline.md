# Ensemble Results by Pipeline

We break down just the [ensemble based multiple parcellation results](./index#multiple- parcellation-strategies) here. Intra and Inter pipeline (corresponding to the top and bottom of the figure below).

![By Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sahahn/parc_scaling/master/analyze/Figures/interpipeline_ensemble_comparison.png)

These results are interesting when contrasted with the same [single parcellation results by pipeline(./by_pipeline.html)]
