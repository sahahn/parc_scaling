# Ensemble Inter-Pipeline Table

This table includes results from the extension [ensemble inter-pipeline comparison](./ensemble_by_pipeline#inter-pipeline-comparison).
The only parcellations used here are ensemble based combinations of multiple parcellations.
The [mean relative rankings](./results_intro#mean-rank) shown here are as
averaged across [target variables](./variables.html) and computed across parcellation and [ML pipeline](./ml_pipelines.html).
Mean R2 and ROC AUC are calculated only from their relevant subsets of 22 and 23 [target variables](./variables.html) respectively.

*Table columns are sortable!*
