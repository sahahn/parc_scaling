This github repository contains READMEs dedicated primarily to explaining the actual usage and structure of this project's code - a separate dedicated project website can be found at https://sahahn.github.io/parc_scaling/ which acts as an online supplementary materials for the paper.

### Directory structure

This project is setup with a few different directories, which if necessary contain their own more detailed READMEs.

- analyze/
- data/
- docs/
- exp/
- extra/
- extra_random_parcels/
- parcels/
- raw/
- setup/

In general those starting with capital letters, (setup/, exp/, analyze/) contain code used to run different steps, with other directories used to store data or parcellations, e.g. (data/, parcels/, ect...).
