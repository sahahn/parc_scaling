# Parcellation Project

It is common to analyze surface-based neuroimaging data, and likewise for a number of reasons to reduce surface data to a collection of representative regions of interest. What about when one is interested in performing machine learning? Is there a best pre-defined parcellation to use? This project seeks to answer that question.

The base experiment conducted within this project is a systematic test of different pre-defined parcellations performance. There are some key decision though which greatly influence the experiment.

### How was the input data as structural MRI surface chosen?

### How is performance defined?

- How were the phenotypes of interest chosen?

- What evaluation strategy should be used?
  
- What metrics should be used?
  
- How should these metrics be combined?
